# [fit] Applied Static Analysis  

Software Technology Group 
Technische Universität Darmstadt
__*Dr. Michael Eichberg*__

Summer Term 2019

# Lecture
Every week at 11:40am in S101|A03.

- We are going to discuss algorithms (static analyses) that can be used to detect code smells and security vulnerabilities by analyzing the (binary) code of applications.
- The concepts generally apply to a very wide range of languages and programming language paradigms.
- The examples and analyses are primarily concerned with Java (Bytecode). 
- The language that we use for implementing analyses is [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org).

The lecture slides can be found at: [https://github.com/stg-tud/apsa](https://github.com/stg-tud/apsa/tree/master/2019).

^ The lecture slides are basically markdown files that are presented using [Deskset](https://www.deskset.com). The final PDF is rendered using [Marked 2](https://marked2app.com) after preprocessing them using the following [sed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed) program:
```bash
/usr/bin/sed -E -e 's/^\[\..+\:.+\]//' -e 's/^\^[[:space:]]//' -e 's/#[[:space:]]\[fit\]/#/'
```
The program basically removes all non-standard markdown commands which are only used/required by Deskset.
Hence, if you have suggestions for improvement or if you find typos or more significant issues don't hesitate to create [issues](https://github.com/stg-tud/apsa/issues). Pull requests are also very welcome.

# Exam

- We will have a closed-book exam after the semester.  
- The exam will be 60 minutes.
- (There will be no bonus.)

---

# Exercise
Every week we will have ~60minutes of lecture and ~30minutes exercises. 

Some exercises will just be theory and some will require you to comprehend and write concrete static analyses. The analyses will be developed using the [OPAL](www.opal-project.de) framework.

The exercises will help you to prepare for the exam.

* Purity and immutability analysis
* Escape analysis/Points-to analysis
* Code slicing

# Prerequisites

 * A keen interest in analyzing code.
 * Basic knowledge in compiler construction is helpful.
 * A very good understanding of object-oriented programming and in-particular of Java.
 * Willing to learn and use Scala.
